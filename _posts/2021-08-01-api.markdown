If you have been a regular computer user, prrobably you have heard of an API. 

An API exposes the functionality without exposing the internals. 

Taking on functions or methods, they work the same as an API. 

Let's take an example of a javascript function. 

	function add(num1, num2){
		return a+b;
	}

This is a simple js function that receives two numbers (num1 and num2) as parameters, it adds the two numbers and returns their sum. 

As the function user, you just call the function with the two numbers and you don't have to worry about how the function is doing what it does. You appreciate the outcome but not how exactly the function gets the desired answer. 

That's all an API does/is. An API could be a function you wrote, a function from a library or method from a freamework or even an http endpoint.
